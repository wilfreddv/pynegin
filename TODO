This is where I put my ideas to implement I come up with on the go:

Basic shapes:
    Lines, rectangles, etc. Just regular 2D drawing stuff.

Animations:
    class that has some image components and loops over them
    accepts 16x16/32x32/.. files with animation tiles things

Fade for components:
    Make a component fade in/out: set alpha higher/lower over time

Hitbox overlay:
    Custom hitbox, right now it's a rectangle

Make resizing possible:
    speaks for itself: resize should set isResized on the window so containers
    can update accordingly
